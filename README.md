- Node.js

#### Front-end:
- React.js

### Installation
Clone the repo

Change to the `backend/api` folder and install the API dependencies.

```
cd backend/api
npm install
```

Change to the `frontend/coplay` folder and install frontend dependencies.

Then you will need to set up MariaDB. See [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) for instructions. For MacOS, see [MariaDB MacOS](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/installing-mariadb-on-macos-using-homebrew/) for instructions.

Once the database is installed, you will have to create a database and  to create an user with access to SELECT, INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE on this database.

Write on the file `backend/api/src/db/DB_CONFIG.js` with your database configuration.

vi backend/api/src/db/DB_CONFIG.js
```

Then the script : `npm run db:init` can be run.
```
cd backend/api
npm run db:init
```

Go to the `backend/api` folder and start the server.
```
cd backend/api
npm start
```

Go to the `frontend/coplay` folder and run the script start script.
```
cd frontend/coplay
npm start
